    "1. **Binary Thresholding (Step 1)**:\n",
    "   - The input image (`img`) is thresholded using a fixed threshold value of 88.\n",
    "   - Pixels with intensity greater than or equal to 88 are set to 255 (white), and pixels below 88 are set to 0 (black).\n",
    "   - This step simplifies the image into a binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Otsu's Thresholding (Step 2)**:\n",
    "   - Otsu's method automatically determines an optimal threshold value based on the image histogram.\n",
    "   - It aims to minimize the intra-class variance within the foreground (text) and background regions.\n",
    "   - The result (`th2`) is a further refined binary image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gaussian Blurring (Step 3)**:\n",
    "   - Gaussian blurring is applied to reduce noise and smooth the image.\n",
    "   - A 5x5 Gaussian kernel is used to convolve with the binary image (`th2`).\n",
    "   - The output (`blur`) is a less noisy version of the binary image.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Otsu's Thresholding (Step 4)**:\n",
    "   - Another Otsu's thresholding is applied to the blurred image (`blur`).\n",
    "   - This step fine-tunes the binary representation, emphasizing text regions while minimizing noise.\n",
    "   - The result (`th3`) is the smoothed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `image_smoothen` function combines these steps to enhance the clarity of text regions in the input image. Adjusting the threshold values and kernel size may further optimize the results based on specific use cases."

    "Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Reading the Image**: The function reads the image specified by the `file_name` parameter in grayscale mode (`0`). Grayscale images have a single channel representing intensity (brightness) rather than color.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Adaptive thresholding is applied to the grayscale image (`img`). It dynamically adjusts the threshold value based on local pixel neighborhoods. This helps filter out noise and enhance text regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Morphological Opening**: Morphological opening is performed using the `kernel`. Opening removes small noise regions (small white spots) by eroding and then dilating the image. It helps clean up the text regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Morphological Closing**: Morphological closing is also performed using the same `kernel`. Closing fills gaps in text regions (small black holes) by dilating and then eroding the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Custom Smoothening**: The `image_smoothen` function (not shown here) further smoothes the image. This step likely involves additional filtering or blurring techniques to improve text clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bitwise OR Operation**: The final result is obtained by combining the smoothened image (`img`) with the closing result using a bitwise OR operation. This ensures that both text regions and gaps are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to replace the `image_smoothen` function with its actual implementation, as it's not defined in the provided code snippet. Additionally, consider adding comments within the `image_smoothen` function to explain its purpose and any specific techniques used."
