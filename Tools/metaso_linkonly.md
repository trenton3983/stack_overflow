The `metaso_linkonly.py` script is a Python program designed to interact with the Stack Exchange API to search for and download specific questions from the Meta Stack Overflow site. The script focuses on questions that contain the phrases like "link only" in their titles.

Here's a breakdown of script functionality:

1. **Setup**: The script begins by importing necessary modules, defining constants, setting up logging, and loading a configuration file to retrieve the API key.

2. **API Endpoint Definition**: The script defines the API endpoint for advanced search on Stack Exchange.

3. **Question Retrieval**: The script sends a GET request to the API endpoint with specific parameters to retrieve questions. It iterates over the returned questions and checks if the title contains "link only", "link-only", or "linkonly". If it does, the question is added to a list of questions.

4. **Backoff Handling**: If the API response includes a "backoff" field, the script will pause execution for the specified number of seconds. This is to respect the rate limits set by the Stack Exchange API.

5. **Error Handling**: If a request to the API fails, the script logs the error and pauses execution for 5 seconds before continuing.

6. **Specific Question Download**: The script also includes code to download a specific question and its answers from the API.

7. **Data Storage**: Finally, the script saves the list of questions to a JSON file and prints the number of questions retrieved.

This script is a useful tool for data collection from the Meta Stack Overflow site, particularly for questions related to "link only" posts.
