# How to Create Effective Stack Overflow Questions

Consider the following guidelines for posting a well-composed question on Stack Overflow to increase the chances of receiving accurate and prompt answers.

[How much research effort is expected of Stack Overflow users?][1] Questions that don't show any effort, or with just text requesting a resolution, are likely to be downvoted and closed.

Take the Stack Overflow [Tour][2] and see the [Help Center][3].

1. **Title**: Make it clear and concise. The title should give an overview of the problem so that potential answerers can quickly understand the issue.

    * Example: "How to rotate x-axis labels"
	
	- Do not put tags, like `seaborn`, `matplotlib` in the title

2. **Introduction**: Start your post with a brief description of your goal.

    * Example: "I am trying to create a Seaborn plot with rotated x-axis labels."

3. **Provide a Minimal, Reproducible Example (MRE)**: This is critical.
    - **Minimal**: Only include the necessary code to reproduce the problem or illustrate your question. Remove everything that doesn’t matter to your current issue.
    - **Reproducible**: Make sure that someone can copy and paste your code into their environment and achieve the same results. This typically involves providing a small dataset or a way to generate one.
    - [**Do not post images of code or data**][4]
	  - Most contributors will not respond to questions without data.
	  - If you must share a file, share it on a free GitHub account, not some other untrusted file sharing service.
	  - Optionally, use a dataset from `seaborn` with [`df = sns.load_dataset(name)`][5], or [scikit-learn datasets][6].
	
    * Example:
        ```python
        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Sample data
        data = {'fruit': ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'count': [5, 7, 3]}
        df = pd.DataFrame(data)

        sns.barplot(x='fruit', y='count', data=df)
        plt.show()
        ```

4. **Include the Error** (if there is one): If you encounter an error, provide the exact error message. 

    * Example: "`ValueError: could not broadcast input array...`"

5. **Explain what you’ve tried**: Detail the approaches you've already taken to solve the problem.

    * Example: "I've tried using `plt.xticks(rotation=45)`, but it doesn’t seem to have any effect."

6. **Include Versions**: Especially for libraries like `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`, the version can sometimes be the cause of or solution to a problem. Use the following to get the version:

    ```python
    print(pd.__version__)
    print(sns.__version__)
    ```

7. **Use Proper Formatting**:
    - Code should be formatted using the `{}` button or by indenting with 4 spaces.
    - If showing a traceback/error, format it as code so it's readable.
    - Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate.

8. **Tag Appropriately**: Tagging helps get the attention of experts in the relevant domains. In your case, you might want to tag `python`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`.

9. **Include Desired vs. Current Output**:
    - Clearly state what you expect to happen or what you want to achieve.
    - Explain what's currently happening and how it differs from your desired output.

10. **Be Respectful and Patient**: Remember that Stack Overflow is a community of volunteers. Always be polite, and don't bump your questions unnecessarily.

After posting your question, actively engage with those who comment or answer. If someone provides a solution or asks for clarification, respond promptly and courteously.

Once your question is resolved, don't forget to **accept the best answer** and [**upvote helpful responses**][7]. This rewards contributors and helps future readers identify the useful solutions.
