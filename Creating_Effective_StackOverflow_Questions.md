# How to Create Effective Stack Overflow Questions

The Stack Overflow [Tour][1] states, _we're working together to build a library of detailed, high-quality answers to every question about programming._

Which means, your question probably has an existing answer, and might get closed as a [duplicate][2].

Prior to posting a question, verify your question is [allowed][3], review [How do I ask a good question?][4], and contributors **usually** expect some adherence to → [How much research effort is expected of Stack Overflow users?][5].

Questions not showing any effort, or with just text requesting a resolution, are **likely** to be downvoted and closed.

Consider the following guidelines for posting a well-composed question on Stack Overflow to increase the chances of receiving accurate and prompt answers.

1. **Title**: Make it clear and concise. The title should give an overview of the problem so that potential answerers can quickly understand the issue.

    * Example: "How to rotate x-axis labels"
	
	- Do not put tags, like `seaborn`, `matplotlib` in the title. See [What are tags, and how should I use them?][6] for the full discussion.

2. **Introduction**: Start your post with a brief description of your goal.

    * Example: "I am trying to create a Seaborn plot with rotated x-axis labels."

3. **Provide a Minimal, Reproducible Example ([MRE][7])**: This is critical.
    - **Minimal**: Only include the necessary code (or sample code) to reproduce the problem or illustrate your question. **Remove everything that doesn’t matter to your current issue**.
    - **Reproducible**: Make sure that someone can copy and paste your code into their environment and achieve the same results. This typically involves providing a small dataset or a way to generate one.
      - [**Do not post images of code or data**][8]
	  - Most contributors will not respond to questions without data.
	    - If you must share a file, share it on a free GitHub account, not some other untrusted file sharing service.
	    - Optionally, use a dataset from `seaborn` with [`df = sns.load_dataset(name)`][9], or [scikit-learn datasets][10].
		- [How to provide a reproducible copy of your DataFrame with to_clipboard][11]
	    - [How to easily share a sample dataframe using df.to_dict][12]
	    - [How to make good reproducible pandas examples][13]
	
    * Example:
        ```python
        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Sample data
        data = {'fruit': ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'count': [5, 7, 3]}
        df = pd.DataFrame(data)

        sns.barplot(x='fruit', y='count', data=df)
        plt.show()
        ```

4. **Include the Error** (if there is one): If you encounter an error, provide the exact error message. 

    * Example: "`ValueError: could not broadcast input array...`"

5. **Explain what you’ve tried**: Detail the approaches you've already taken to solve the problem.

    * Example: "I've tried using `plt.xticks(rotation=45)`, but it doesn’t seem to have any effect."

6. **Include Versions**: Especially for libraries like `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`, the version can sometimes be the cause of or solution to a problem. Use the following to get the version:

    ```python
    print(pd.__version__)
    print(sns.__version__)
    ```

7. **Use Proper Formatting**:
    - Code should be formatted using the `{}` button or by indenting with 4 spaces.
    - If showing a traceback/error, format it as code so it's readable.
    - Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate.
    - [How do I format my posts using Markdown or HTML?][14]

8. **Tag Appropriately**: Tagging helps get the attention of experts in the relevant domains. In your case, you might want to tag `python`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`.

9. **Include Desired vs. Current Output**:
    - Clearly state what you expect to happen or what you want to achieve.
    - Explain what's currently happening and how it differs from your desired output.
	- If necessary, include a hand-drawn example.

10. **Be Respectful and Patient**: Remember that Stack Overflow is a community of volunteers. Always be polite, and don't bump your questions unnecessarily.

After posting your question, actively engage with those who comment or answer. If someone provides a solution or asks for clarification, respond promptly and courteously.

Once your question is resolved, don't forget to **accept the best answer** and [**upvote helpful responses**][15]. This rewards contributors and helps future readers identify the useful solutions.
